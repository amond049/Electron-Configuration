# Electron-Configuration
This program can aid the user in finding either the shorthand or longhand electron configurations for every element in the periodic table. In order to ensure the proper operation of this program, you will need to have the periodictable python library installed. 

This can be done via typing in pip(3) install periodictable

I hope you enjoy the program!
