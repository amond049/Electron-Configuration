# Electron-Configuration
This program can aid the user in finding either the shorthand or longhand electron configurations for every element in the periodic table. In order to ensure the proper operation of this program, you will need to have the periodictable python library installed. 

This can be done via typing in pip(3) install periodictable

Now you may notice that there seem to be three files, one named electronconfiguration.py, electronconfigurationGUI.py and the final one  being named ElementDecoder.py. The first one is a standalone python program, it will run it in the compiler and there no graphical elements. As for the second file, this program comes fit with an easy-going UI filled with buttons, labels and entry widgets. The third file is the exact opposite of the first two. This one can take in an electron configuration and then spit out the appropriate element. It can handle both shorthand and longhand electron configurations. This can also exception handle for everything (I HOPE) so anything you throw at it, the program will deal with it in some manner. 

Choose whichever one you feel as though would be the best for your needs, and test it out for all of your electron configuration needs! 


I hope you enjoy the program!
